# Compression Streams Specification

This repository is the temporary home of the Compression Streams Specification,
which defines the APIs CompressionStream and DecompressionStream.

See the [text of the specification](https://ricea.github.io/compression/) or
read [the
explainer](https://github.com/ricea/compressstream-explainer/blob/master/README.md)
to find out what this is all about.
